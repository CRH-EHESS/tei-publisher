         <p><persName corresp="#p_SEA_1">SHEVARDNADZE</persName> opened the meeting by welcoming
            the Secretary and his delegation, noting that he was glad to see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RRL_1">Ridgway</persName> once again.</p>
         <p>The Foreign Minister expressed satisfaction that the Secretary had been able to reach
            Moscow despite the transportation problems he had faced. The meeting was one of
            great importance. <persName corresp="#p_SEA_1">Shevardnadze</persName> did not need
            to tell the Secretary how critical their Washington discussions<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2" place="foot">See <ref target="#d66">Documents 66</ref>–<ref target="#d76">76</ref>.</note> had been; he had already given his assessment
            at the time and when they met in New York.<note n="3" xml:id="d80fn3" place="foot">See <ref target="#d78">Document 78</ref>.</note> The whole world had responded
            to the results of the Washington visit.</p>
         <pb n="409" facs="0446" xml:id="pg_409"/>
         <p>The current moment in <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations,
            <persName corresp="#p_SEA_1">Shevardnadze</persName> felt, was a crucial one.
            There were important problems to be discussed. Tomorrow the Secretary would meet
            General Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Gorbachev</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d80fn4" place="foot">See <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note>
            That meeting would deal with the key problems on the agenda, with respect to both
            substance and future contacts. The results of the ministers work today, <persName corresp="#p_SEA_1">Shevardnadze</persName> stressed, would determine what the
            General Secretary would have to say on future contacts. He had been intimately
            involved in preparations for the Secretary’s visit, and would make the final
            decisions. As to the organization of the visit, <persName corresp="#p_SEA_1">Shevardnadze</persName>’s preference was to focus most of the discussion in the
            present narrow group. He liked the flexibility which this approach had given during
            the Washington meetings. Given the limited time available, <persName corresp="#p_SEA_1">Shevardnadze</persName> suggested that the ministers might
            hold a brief plenary session with their delegations to allow working groups to get
            underway immediately. The session need take no more than a few minutes, after which
            the ministers could resume their discussion.</p>
